<h2 id="meet#3">Meet #3 Report - 22nd June 2024</h2>
<p>First meet report on the site, this is a reflection of our third meet as we did not have a site on meet #1 and #2. This isn't to say that we can't add them at a later date if people remember. The weather was slightly cloudy on this day of meet #3, as two of our members could not make it on this meet, attendees were unsure of how many there would be there.</p>

<p>Aurora arrived at the pre-meet location at 12:00 due to them having to have their car serviced, this is later than what would usually happen at this meet. The pre-meet was a party of one due to people showing up late. Aurora started heading to the main meet point at 12:30 and met up with Aquilla then Juniper and Echo. We had some food there, we hung around until about 14:30 after the match started. Echo was talking about one bus in particular they were hunting and it was in the area, so once we had finished our drinks we took the meet on the road. First stop was Portland Street so Echo could photograph this special e400 in the old GMBuses colours. They managed to get the desired photo, which made them happy. We continued on to the Arndale to our usual bubble tea place.</p>

<p>Myself and Juniper got ours then Echo wanted to go look at camera equipment in CEX and Aquilla wanted to go to the lego store.</p>

<p>Aquilla had an idea to make lego minifigures of everyone. But we didn't do our own. Above is what resulted from this experiment.</p>

<p>After we did this experiment, we went for a wander, including a flying visit to Afflecks. It was at this point Aquilla had to leave to get home, but Aurora, Echo, with Juniper went for a wander to see what else they could find. Echo and Aurora saw Juniper to their car. Aurora and Echo went back to piccadilly, where they had a go on one of the new pianos there. Shortly after that, they called the end of the meet and went for our respective transport back home.</p>
